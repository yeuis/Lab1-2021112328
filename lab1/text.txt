I think smiling is as important as sunshine. Smiling is like sunshine because it can make people happy and have a good day. If you happy, you can smile, and then you will feel happy. Someone may say, “But I feel happy.” Then I would say, “Please smile as you do when you are happy or play with your friends happily. You will really be happy again.”Smiling can let you have more friends.So I say, smiling is like a flower. It will give you happiness.
